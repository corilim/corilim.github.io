            <b>Abstract:</b> ‘Sculpting light’ means spatially patterning laser beams. This enables more than just creating pretty pictures — the exquisite control we now have over millions of parameters within optical fields has triggered a raft of new technologies. Here I will introduce two areas of active research. Firstly I will give an overview of ‘optically actuated micro-robotics’: Light carries momentum. This momentum can be used to exert forces on microscopic objects, and even capture and move them around. This technique is called 'Optical tweezers’, and its inventor, Arthur Ashkin, shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for his discovery. Optical tweezers act like miniature tractor beams inside a microscope - and using them allows us to not only observe the microscopic world, but also interact with it, build microscopic structures, and measure tiny forces between objects such as living cells. I will discuss how we are applying robotic principles to optical tweezers - to create devices that can explore micro-scale environments autonomously. Secondly, I will describe how to make objects ‘computational transparent’: Shine a laser pointer on your hand, and some of the light will go through. The same is true for a sugar cube. Yet we can’t see through these materials. This is because during its passage, the light is scattered multiple times, scrambling the spatial information it carries and preventing the formation of images. ‘Unscrambling’ this light again was long considered an intractable problem. However, modern light shaping technology can be used to measure and reverse these scattering effects - effectively rendering biological tissue and sugar cubes ‘computationally transparent’. I will describe progress in this exciting field, and the hurdles yet to overcome before a new generation of cameras will revolutionise medical imaging.
