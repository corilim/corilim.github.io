            <h3>Prof Giles Hammond</h3>
            <img src="/img/giles_hammond.jpg" alt="Giles Hammond" class="bio" />
			<p>
				Giles Hammond obtained his PhD from the University of Birmingham in 1998. His research focussed on building a superconducting torsion balance to search for violations of the equivalence principle and perform precision measurements of the Casimir force. He then spent two years at JILA, University of Colorado at Boulder, building inertial seismic isolation systems for the advanced LIGO gravitational wave upgrade.			
			</p>
			<p>
In 2007 Giles moved to Glasgow where he works on the development of ultralow thermal noise suspensions operating at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. He led the development, installation and characterisation of the fused silica suspension systems in the Hanford and Livingston gravitational wave detectors for the aLIGO upgrade. These detectors made the first detection of gravitational waves from a black hole binary system on 14th September 2015, opening up the gravitational window on the Universe.			
			</p>
			<p>
Giles also leads an activity within the National Quantum Technology Programme. He has pioneered the development of a new type of gravimeter based on MEMS technology, with a sensitivity sufficient to measure the earth tides; elastic deformations of the earth due to the moon/sun potential. This work was published in the March 2016 issue of Nature and offers a transformative new way to provide cost effective monitoring of the gravitational field, with applications in the areas of environment monitoring, navigation and defence & security. There are currently three instruments installed on Mt Etna, and one instrument located on the Poas active volcano in Costa Rica.			
			</p>
			<p>
Professor Hammond is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (IoP) and Royal Society of Edinburgh.

                <h4>Gravitational Wave Astronomy</h4>
                <p>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave observatory comprises two detectors located in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana. These detectors are 4km long Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometers and the most sensitive length measuring devices in the world. They are able to sense a change equivalent to 1/1000th the diameter of a proton over their 4km baseline. The interferometers utilise a 1064nm Nd-YAG laser to illuminate the cavity mirrors. The mirrors are operated as free test masses, requiring multiple stage pendulum suspensions and inertial seismic isolation to ensure that seismic noise does not limit the detector sensitivity. The final stage of the suspension is fabricated entirely from fused silica to ensure that thermal noise does not limit their sensitivity.
                </p>
                <p>
    In this talk I will describe the technology development necessary to realise the LIGO detectors, and also describe the signals measured during the first 4 observing runs of aLIGO. I will provide some insight into the astrophysics which can be gained from these &quot;dark systems&quot;, only observable by listening to the Universe, and discuss the future opportunities of the field.

            <img src="/img/paula_stella_de_viveiros_teixeira.jpg" alt="Paula Stella de Viveiros Teixeira" class="bio" />
            <p>
                Paula recently joined the University of Dundee as a Physics Lecturer and researcher in Renewable Energy and sustainability. She was a Smithsonian Predoctoral Fellow at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, USA, where she carried out her doctoral research, and obtained a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics by the University of Lisbon, Portugal. She worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the European Southern Observatory in Germany, at the University of Vienna in Austria, and at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, where she became a lecturer in 2021. Her current research interests encompass climate and environmental change; impacts of extreme events; climate risk assessment; Renewable Energy; and adaptation, resilience, and sustainability in a changing climate.

                <h4>Powering Scotland with Renewable Energy</h4>
                <p>
                    The impacts of global climate change, including global warming and water cycle changes, are accelerating as fossil fuel generated greenhouse gases and aerosols (pollution particles) in our atmosphere continue to increase. Such impacts encompass more extreme heat, more droughts and floods, more intense hurricanes and wildfires, more air pollution and heat-related deaths and illnesses, agricultural shifts and famine, species extinction, etc. Do we need miracle technologies to stop climate change and air pollution? No. Then what is the solution? It is the transition from exhaustible fossil fuels to renewable and practically inexhaustible energy resources. Such a technological and socio-economic solution is feasible at 100% level with clear benefits to climate, air pollution, energy security and economy. This talk will cover onshore wind, offshore wind, solar and tidal energy potential and development in and around Scotland. I will explore aspects of the science, technology, economics, policy, and social aspects of such transition for sustainable development.

            <h3>Dr Ian Whittaker</h3>
            <img src="/img/ian_whittaker.jpg" alt="Ian Whittaker" class="bio" />
            <p>
            Dr Whittaker graduated from the University of Leicester with a Masters in Physics with Space Science and Technology, while his doctoral research was performed at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth - focussed on the upper atmosphere of Venus. Since the completion of his PhD thesis, Dr Whittaker has held six postdoctoral research contracts around the UK and New Zealand. This research has spanned space, meteorology, and medical physics. He has also had the amazing experience of working in the Antarctic at Scott Base
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2019 Dr Whittaker won the Sir Paul Curran Award for Academic Communication from the The Conversation. His current public science profile also includes articles in national newspapers, BBC Frontiers magazine, and Physiology Today. His current readership in The Conversation is over 4 million and he is the most read author from NTU. These articles have led to a range of radio and tv interviews both nationally and internationally.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2021 Dr Whittaker won the Vice Chancellors Outstanding Teaching Award for an Early Career Teacher, and also the NTSU Teaching Award for Science and Technology.
